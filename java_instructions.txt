How to run Java

Create the project on the Remote Machine -> really easy w/ Visual Studio Code
If not, just create the same directory tree I guess

If using VS Code, check the mvn / java plugin


Maven (mvn) should also have some clickable commands on the right bottom corner. If not

mvn compile
mvn package

package creates a jar file in /target

**** For GraphFrames ****

get the graphframes jar and save it locally like /home/s3072347/project/gf_jar/graphframes-0.8.0-spark2.4-s_2.11.jar

mbd is the java project root dir
the command below works when in the /mbd/ dir

spark-submit --class "com.graph.GraphFrameEx" --master local[4] --jars target/mbd-1.jar, /home/s3072347/project/gf_jar/graphframes-0.8.0-spark2.4-s_2.11.jar

**** Done with GraphFrames ****

but kindly fuck graphframes
to use only graphX, run the GraphExample class:

spark-submit --class "com.graph.GraphExample" --master local[4] target/mbd-1.jar
